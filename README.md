The code is a program that solves a maze puzzle for a mouse. It uses a stack to track the mouse's movements. The maze is a grid with open and closed cells. The program starts at the mouse's position and tries to find a path to the exit. It explores neighboring cells, marks them as visited, and continues until it reaches the exit or has no more options. It shows the maze visually and informs the user of the result.
